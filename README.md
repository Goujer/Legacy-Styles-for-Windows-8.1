This would not be possible without nptr's [msstyleEditor](https://github.com/nptr/msstyleEditor), please send him a thank you if you enjoy this.

## Contributions
Not everything can be ported, so some features may be missing.

That said if you spy something should definitely be changed create an issue for it.

If you are more technically or graphically inclined and can make better upscales of some of the images or know how to get some missing parts in go ahead and make the changes and submit a pull request.

PNG are named by both their index in Windows 8.1's msstyle and a sort of path like naming scheme; the indexes are preferred.
